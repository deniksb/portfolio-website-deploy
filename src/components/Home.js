        <p>My name is Denislav Berberov and I have been programming for the past 3 years. During this time I have acquired knowledge in technologies such as Java/Java Spring Boot, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, SQL, HTML, CSS, Python and a bit of React. I have a good understanding of Object Oriented Programming and the SOLID principles.
I have worked solo on multiple game and web development projects for clients but I also have experience with group work in a SCRUM fashion with the Agile methodology.
I am particularly interested in Web Development and currently live in Bulgaria but am open to remote work all over the world.</p>
